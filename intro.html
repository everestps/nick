        <div id="five"> <h3>Intro</h3> Hello! Welcome to my
	
     website! Glad to see you stopped by.
    	The main purpouse of this website is to explain the main compenents of coding and software. I hope to explain the following information to the best of my ability:
    	<ul>
    	    <li> Computer Hardware</li>
    	    <li> HTML basics</li>
    	    <li> My experiences with coding (About me)</li> 
    	</ul>
    	
    	<p>  I hope teach you at least one new thing that you will find interesting, cool, or even inspiring about coding or computer hardware that you were unaware of before. In my breif experience with coding I have found that for me at least it is difficult in the sense that coding has to be precise. Because of this minimal errors have to be made, and when errors are made, they have to be precisely corrected. I personally make typos frequently and an abundent amount of mistakes, wich is why I have so far found code so challenging. Hopefully my explinations will help you if you chose to persue coding!   </p>
    <br /> 
    	The table below gives a breif overview of what i will try to cover.
