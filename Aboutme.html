<h2>About me</h2>
  Hello! Welcome to my about me page! I am a sophmore at Everest public high school and I am curently enrolled in a computer science course. I live in the bay area in san carlos. Although I have only travelled out of state a few times, I have been to many different places in California. Ever since I  was a kid, I was intruiged with graphical design in movies and games, wich is a big reason for why I signed up for a course about computer science, but I also wanted to learn how to express my ideas in a creative way, wich is another big reason for why I want to learn about coding.

  One of my passions is playing music, I have played saxaphone for about three years and I enjoy it. I also like to help out in my community. This year however, I think that learning more about code will be a new interest of mine.
